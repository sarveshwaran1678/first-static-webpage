      <p>While many eager clients will want to dive right into content production, it's important that you reel them back in by reminding them of the importance of a sound content marketing strategy.

The development of a strategy will help you to generate a better understanding of where they stand currently and what they need to do to get to where they want to be.

One of the most important parts of this process is organizing the development of buyer personas. Even if your client already has them in place, it's important that you evaluate their quality and identify ways to strengthen them. This is a critical first step, as the personas you create will then be used to guide the direction of future content creation.

Aside from personas, you'll also want to perform an audit of the client's existing content. Many businesses will have a handful of ungated whitepapers or a dozen blog articles that could be repurposed or reformatted to provide you with a starting point for content creation.

Once you have a sense of what you want to publish, you'll also want to set them up with a way to organize their content efforts. We recommend building a content marketing editorial calendar. Depending on the amount of content they intended to publish, this could be broken down into separate calendars -- blog, social media, and email.

This is a critical step because it helps both you and the client visualize progress, frequency, publishing patterns, etc.
